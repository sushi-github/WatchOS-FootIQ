# ‚öΩ True Football Data Collector ‚Äì FootIQ

**FootIQ** is an advanced football activity tracker for iOS and watchOS, built to turn casual matches and training sessions into meaningful data-driven insights. By combining Apple Watch GPS and HealthKit data with AI-powered tactical analysis, it gives players real feedback on how they play ‚Äî and how to improve.

This project is a solo build over summer (June‚ÄìSeptember), designed to explore and demonstrate:
- Full-stack development on iOS and watchOS using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, **CoreLocation**, and **HealthKit**
- The practical integration of **LLMs and machine learning** for personalised sports analytics
- Clean UX, gamified progression, and real-world mobile architecture

This `README.md` includes:
- üõ†Ô∏è Feature roadmap
- üîç Technical decisions
- üöß Development phases
- üìö Documentation

By bridging mobile development, AI, and real-world performance tracking, FootIQ brings elite-level football analytics to everyday players ‚Äî with the depth and polish of a production-ready tool.

## üîç Research and Requirements

**FootIQ** is an innovative application designed for both watchOS and iOS, aiming to bring **comprehensive football activity tracking** to Apple devices.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Native Tracking

Traditionally, the Apple Watch has categorized football as a generic cardio activity, capturing only basic metrics such as:

- ü´Ä Heart Rate  
- ‚è±Ô∏è Duration  
- üî• Calories Burned  

This approach **overlooks critical performance indicators** essential for football players ‚Äî such as **positional data**, **sprint intensity**, and **tactical movements**.

---

### üÜï Advancements in watchOS

With the release of **watchOS 11**, Apple introduced major updates to its Workout capabilities, including:

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Distance and Speed Tracking**  
  Utilizes GPS more efficiently to measure player movement.

- üìä **Effort Rating (RPE)**  
  A new post-match stat that combines heart rate, pace, and personal thresholds to calculate how demanding the session was (1‚Äì10 scale).  
  _This mirrors metrics used in sports science like Relative Perceived Exertion._

### ‚öΩ Why Football Needs Specialised Metrics

Despite these improvements, the **unique demands of football** still aren't fully captured by general-purpose fitness tracking. Key metrics like:

- üî• **GPS Heatmaps** ‚Äì To assess positional tactics and zones covered  
- ‚ö° **Sprint Bursts & Running Load** ‚Äì To measure explosiveness and endurance  
- üß† **Match Intelligence** ‚Äì Goals, assists, cards, etc., essential to player evaluation

While professional leagues use high-end systems (e.g. GPS vests, optical tracking), **amateur players lack access** to these insights ‚Äî even though they deserve it just as much.

---

### üß† The FootIQ Solution

**FootIQ** brings elite-level analytics to grassroots players by combining:

- üìç **Location-based movement heatmaps**
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Health + sprint + effort data**
- üß† **AI-powered tactical insights**
- üîÑ **Role-based overlays (e.g. touchline winger, inverted forward, wingback)**

It empowers players to:

- Understand how they move on the pitch  
- Compare themselves to elite tactical patterns  
- Get feedback on how to improve ‚Äî or where their true role may lie

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Wearable Device Rules in Football

According to the official [IFAB Laws of the Game](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-players-equipment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com):

> "A player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous."

This includes **watches and smart wearables during official matches**. Therefore:

> üõ°Ô∏è **FootIQ is designed for friendlies, kickabouts, and training sessions only** ‚Äî where these rules are not enforced.

## üí° Example Use Case

> User A downloads the app  
> - Age: 20  
> - Gender: Male  
> - Wants to Change Position  
> - Current Position: Right Wing-Back (RWB)  
> - Preferred Position: Right Winger (RW)

### Step 1: Onboarding & Profile Setup  
User A opens FootIQ on iPhone and fills out the onboarding form, specifying his current and preferred playing positions along with basic info. This data helps personalise the tactical feedback and heatmap overlays he will receive.

### Step 2: Pre-Match Setup on Apple Watch  
Before starting a match or training session, User A uses the minimal watchOS interface to select he position he is playing in this match (RW), enabling accurate contextual tracking. He can also mark pitch side switches to ensure the heatmap correctly reflects his movements relative to the pitch during half times for example.

### Step 3: Match Tracking  
During the game, the Apple Watch tracks User A‚Äôs GPS location, heart rate, sprints, and motion data in real-time. 
The watch app records all movement and physical metrics with minimal interaction required from the player. 
User A can also add in Goals Contributions he provided, as well as Cards received.
On the watch, basic health tracking is displayed such as HR, Steps, Distance Covered, Average and Peak Pace, and Time

### Step 4: Post-Match Analysis on iPhone  
After the match, User A syncs his data to the iPhone app where:

- His GPS heatmap visualises areas covered on the pitch as a RW, compared to standard RW positional templates.
- Physical performance metrics (e.g., sprint bursts, average pace, heart rate zones) are presented alongside movement data.
- AI-driven feedback from the LLM personal coach analyses his positioning, suggesting improvements to align better with the RW role.
- Manual input allows User A to add goals, assists, cards here too as well as match context like opponent difficulty and scoreline for richer insights.

### Step 5: Tactical Insights & Progression  
Based on collected data and AI advice, User A can:

- Understand if his movements align better with his current RWB role or his preferred RW role.
- Receive personalised drills and tactical tips to transition smoothly to RW.
- Track progression over multiple matches via gamified metrics that boost engagement and reflect skill growth.

### Broader Impact  
FootIQ bridges the gap between casual football players and professional-level data analytics by offering a user-friendly, data-driven approach to understanding and improving football performance ‚Äî all through the power of Apple Watch sensors, iOS visualisation, and AI coaching.
